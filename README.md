## Our Project
* We set out to build a site where you can look up the stats of any Pokemon by either name or number.

## User Story
* GIVEN a need to search for a Pokemon
* WHEN I search for a Pokemon by typing name or number in the search field and press the GENERATE button.
* THEN a high-quality, sprite representing a Pokemon and its abilities are dynamically generated.
* WHEN I press the save button
* THEN the last Pokemon generated will be saved to localstorage
* WHEN I select the delete button.
* THEN the last Pokemon searched is removed from the screen.

## MVP - Function
* When I search the name of number of a pokemon and press the Enter key the Pokemon sprite displays up and lists a few abilities <br>

## API's Used 

* [Nickname Generator](https://fungenerators.com/name/pokemon/)  <br>
